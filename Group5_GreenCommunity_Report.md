## Introduction

Hong Kong is facing a critical waste management crisis. For decades, our landfills have been nearing capacity, a clear signal that landfilling is not a sustainable long-term solution. This makes the transition to a circular economy not just an environmental ideal, but a civic necessity for our city.

The government's "Waste Blueprint for 2035" acknowledges this challenge with a vision of "Waste Reduction, Resources Circulation, and Zero Landfill." A key goal of this blueprint is to raise the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) recycling rate to 55%. This objective directly supports the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11), which calls for creating sustainable cities by reducing their adverse environmental impact, particularly through effective waste management.

To achieve this, the government launched its flagship strategy: the Green@Community (G@C) recycling network. This program was designed to make recycling convenient for every citizen and promote waste reduction at the source. However, after nearly a decade of operation and a massive increase in public funding, its effectiveness is questionable. Public opinion is mixed, and the city's overall recycling rate has barely changed.

This report addresses the gap between the program's investment and its results. Through a data-driven evaluation, we investigate the true effectiveness of the G@C network. Our research is guided by two key questions:

- **Effectiveness Evaluation:** To what extent is the G@C program effective, considering its city-wide impact relative to its massive operating costs?
- **Strategic Improvement:** How can the program's effectiveness be improved through better data governance and smarter, data-driven incentives?

By answering these questions, this report provides policymakers with a clear assessment and actionable recommendations to reform the G@C program, paving the way for a more sustainable and data-driven approach to waste management in Hong Kong.

## Background

### Policy Context

For many years, Hong Kong's recycling efforts relied on the roadside three-colour bins. However, these were plagued by high contamination rates and low public trust, often ridiculed by citizens as "trash bins in disguise." The "Waste Blueprint for 2035" aimed to change this perception by creating a professionally managed, clean recycling system.

The Green@Community (G@C) network, launched in 2015 and managed by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), was the answer. It was designed not just as a set of collection points, but as a trustworthy brand. The network's clean, modern, and staffed facilities were intended to rebuild public confidence in the recycling chain. Since 2015, the network has expanded aggressively across the territory with Recycling Stations, Recycling Stores, and mobile Recycling Spots.

To further encourage participation, the G@C network is supported by the GREEN$ Participation Incentive Scheme (PIS). Launched with a Smart Card in 2020 and a mobile app in 2022, the scheme rewards citizens with points for recycling, which can be redeemed for gifts. The underlying strategy has been to combine convenient infrastructure with a rewarding incentive to motivate more citizens to recycle.

### The Current State of Data Governance

While the G@C's physical infrastructure has been modernized, the data infrastructure that supports it remains archaic. Our research found that the program's data governance is characterized by fragmentation, opacity, and a "passive disclosure" model. This lack of transparency prevents public accountability and hinders effective, data-driven decision-making.

#### The "Passive Disclosure" Paradox

Hong Kong has a dedicated open data platform, data.gov.hk, which is meant to centralize government data for public access and transparent governance. Ideally, all operational data for a major public program like G@C should be available there in machine-readable formats.

However, we found that critical data—such as operating costs, gift procurement fees, and specific recycling volumes—was absent from the platform. Instead, these data points are buried within complex, text-heavy PDF documents from the Legislative Council's "Examination of Estimates of Expenditure." This creates a system of "passive disclosure," where data is only made public if a lawmaker happens to ask the right question during the annual budget review. For example, we could not find the cost of GREEN$ reward gifts for the 2023-24 fiscal year, likely because no one asked for it. This ad-hoc approach creates arbitrary data gaps, making it nearly impossible for the public to track the program's performance over time.

#### The Personal Data Contradiction

We encountered a disturbing contradiction regarding the collection of user demographics. The GREEN$ mobile app's "Personal Information Collection Statement" explicitly states that personal data is collected for statistical purposes, and our own test registration confirmed that the app prompts users for their gender, birthday, occupation, and district.

Yet, when we sent a formal email to the EPD requesting an anonymized summary of this demographic data, their official reply stated they "had never collected personal information for any purpose." This response points to a significant failure in data governance. Either the government is collecting sensitive citizen data but managing it so poorly that relevant departments are unaware, or it is not using the data it collects for its stated purpose of analysis. Both scenarios are unacceptable.

#### The "Population Coverage" Black Box

The government frequently claims that the G@C network covers a high percentage of the population, citing this as a key success metric. However, the methodology behind this calculation is a complete "black box." In 2018, the Audit Commission questioned the credibility of this claim and recommended that the EPD disclose its formula. Years later, our research found that the definition of "coverage" remains unpublished. Without a transparent definition, this metric is unverifiable and scientifically meaningless for policy evaluation.

## Data Analysis

To evaluate the G@C program, we used a mixed-methods approach. We analyzed the "hard" numbers of costs and tonnage from government sources, and we explored the "soft" factors of public attitudes and behaviors through our own online survey.

### Finding 1: A High-Cost Program with Low City-Wide Impact

Our first step was to analyze the relationship between the government's investment and the program's actual impact. The data tells a story of explosive spending with minimal results.

The operating cost of the G@C network has grown exponentially, from less than HK$6 million in its early years to a projected HK$475 million for the 2024-25 fiscal year. This massive spending was driven by the government's strategy of rapid physical expansion, which focused on increasing the number of collection points across the city.

![Aggregate No. of G@C Collection Points & G@C Operating Cost](./gac_cost_analysis.png)

However, this huge investment has failed to move the needle on Hong Kong's overall recycling performance. The city's MSW recycling rate has remained stuck between 29% and 36% for nearly a decade, far from the 55% target. The most shocking finding is that the entire G@C network, despite its high visibility and cost, contributes only 1% of Hong Kong's total recycled MSW. For a flagship program, this impact is unacceptable, especially when the cost to recycle 1 tonne of waste through G@C remains over HK$10,000.

### Finding 2: A Strategy of Diminishing Returns

We then looked closer at the G@C program's own performance. Our analysis revealed a clear plateau effect, confirming a strategy of diminishing returns. In the program's early years, adding a new station brought a significant jump in recycling volume as it captured the "low-hanging fruit" of eager recyclers.

However, recent data shows this is no longer the case. In 2024, the EPD expanded the network by a massive 260%, but recycling volume only increased by 55%. While funding and the number of facilities continue to climb, the growth rate of recycling volume is slowing down. We have reached a saturation point where the benefit of adding another recycling store is far less than it used to be. This confirms that the program's bottleneck is no longer a lack of convenience, but a lack of motivation.

### Finding 3: A Fundamental Failure of Motivation

To understand why a convenient network was not being used, we conducted an online survey of 128 citizens. The results clearly diagnose the core problem: a failure of motivation.

Our survey found that over 90% of citizens believe recycling is important. However, good intentions are not translating into action. Over 60% of respondents had never used a G@C facility in the past year. When we dug deeper, we found that this was not due to a lack of awareness. Over 75% of these non-users knew where their local G@C was, and for most, it was less than a 15-minute walk away.

When we asked non-users why they didn't participate, the top answers were simply "No recycling habit" and "Don't want to bother." They know recycling is important, they know where to go—they just don't go. This tells us that for many people, the effort required to collect, clean, and carry their recyclables to a G@C point is too high, and the current incentive is not strong enough to overcome this barrier.

The incentive scheme is not only weak, but it is also severely underfunded. Our analysis of government documents revealed that the budget for GREEN$ reward gifts is only 2% of the program's total operating cost. The government is spending nearly half a billion dollars on operations but almost nothing on the rewards that are meant to motivate people.

Furthermore, the GREEN$ scheme is failing to attract new people to recycling. Our survey showed that over 75% of G@C users were already recycling before the program started. It is primarily serving existing recyclers, not growing the base. Our regression analysis also found that participation is significantly higher among older residents, suggesting the current rewards of rice and oil are narrowly targeted and fail to motivate younger people.

This problem is being made worse by a recent government decision to force a complete digitalization of the GREEN$ scheme, remove popular physical gifts, and limit redemptions. This move, made without consulting environmental groups, risks alienating the elderly, who are currently the most active users, and makes the weak incentive even weaker.

### Finding 4: Public Perception vs. Data-Driven Reality

To confirm our conclusion, we conducted an experiment in our survey. First, we asked people for their opinion of G@C's effectiveness, and the initial response was generally positive. Then, we showed them the real data: the high costs, the low recycling volume, and the tiny 1% city-wide impact.

After seeing the data, their opinions flipped. Almost half of the respondents lowered their rating of the program. The "Very Unsatisfactory" rating shot up from 11% to 29%. This proves that while G@C may look good on the surface, a data-driven evaluation reveals it to be a high-cost program with low impact, suffering from a fundamental failure to motivate new participants.

---

## Community Engagement

Our project was not just about analyzing data; it was about engaging with the community and using modern tools to uncover the truth.

We engaged with the government directly through our formal "Access to Information" request to the EPD. While the request was mostly denied, the interaction itself became a key research finding. It proved the administration's opacity and highlighted a bureaucratic disconnect, where the IT systems collect data that the policy bureau claims not to have.

Our primary form of citizen engagement was our online survey. By distributing it to our families, friends, and neighbors, we collected 128 responses from the very people the G@C program is meant to serve. The survey was not just a data collection tool; it was an educational one, as we shared our key findings with the participants.

To manage the complexity of our analysis, we integrated AI tools responsibly. We used "Vibe Coding" with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot to help write the code for our statistical analysis, such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and regression calculations. This allowed us to ensure our models were robust and minimized human error in complex calculations. However, we were careful to maintain human oversight at all times. We only fed the AI data that we had manually collected and verified, ensuring our conclusions were based on real, human-validated facts.

## Recommendations

An action plan targeting the Hong Kong Government, Environmental Protection Department, Legislative Council, and other stakeholders is offered based on the quantitative analysis, results of the survey, and following SDG 11.6 which targets the reduction of environmental impact of cities. These are solutions to the G@C program core challenges of diminishing returns, ineffective incentives, and a lack of appropriate data governance using empirical data to improve the cost-effectiveness, participation, and accountability without adding to the overall fiscal input.

### 5.1 Shift from Inefficient Blind Expansion to Strategic Utilization of Available Resources

With an increment of 260% in G@C stations, only enhanced the recycling volume by 55%, and the program only added 1% to the total of recycling wastes in Hong Kong. To change this state of inefficiency, station approvals must be halted over 12 months and 40% of the expansion budget must be re-allocated to improve the existing sites. The working hours could be increased to accommodate those people who work in offices, clear sorting instructions placed on items that are difficult to identify, for example bubble wrap and intelligent weighing machines added. The restructure of the network according to population and demand heatmaps should be done in GIS mapping by combining the stations with poor performance, with monthly volume less than half of the average. This is a realignment based on survey data indicating that 75% of residents are already familiar with nearby stations and 80% reside within a 15-minute walking distance, which proves the accessibility to be no longer a decisive factor. These kinds of adjustments may enhance the efficiency of its operations and also increase the usefulness of available resources.

### 5.2 Reform the Incentive System to Increase Participation

The mandatory digitalization of GREEN$ should be reversed, as regression analysis identifies elderly residents as core program participants, and the policy risks excluding this group. Multi-channel redemption such as smart cards, mobile applications, and physical gifts need to be maintained. Incentive budget needs to be raised to 15% of total operation costs out of the reallocated expansion funds to create demographic-based rewards: daily requirements of seniors, e-coupons to youth with high-opportunity costs, and family-based points to family involvement. The deposit-refund system with high frequency items like beverage bottles should be tested with reference to the successful model of Germany. Refinement of incentives must be conducted in three months time, based on the participation data on the basis of A/B testing, with the main focus of addressing key barrier, where 60% of survey respondents fail to use G@C program in spite of the understanding of the importance of recycling, which is mainly caused by lack of motivation. This segmented strategy will increase the engagement of all age groups and push the volume towards significant numbers.

### 5.3 Implement Open Data Governance to Enhance Accountability

A centralized open data platform must be deployed in six months with monthly station-level data such as the volume of recycling, unit cost, and coverage being released. The ambiguity on the calculation method of 80% population coverage which was raised by the Audit Commission should be elucidated. It should be obligatory to make quarterly performance reports and bi-annual public consultations with NGOs and the community members. Credit should be brought in by introducing annual third party audits on data accuracy aimed at checking the recycling volume and cost accounting. The environmental protection department data would be combined with the waste generation and the food and environmental hygiene department data would also be combined and cross-departmental data warehousing on waste management would be developed by referring to the open data portal in Singapore which promoted engagement of people in policy making by 41%. This open system of governance will allow open control by the population, instill confidence, and provide the program with a sense of responsibility in its outcomes.

The implementation can be divided into three waves: within three months, urgent policy corrections (reversing digitalization, pausing expansions) will be implemented; within 12 months, the construction of the system (data platform launch, site upgrades) will be carried out; within 24 months, full-scale promotion (differentiated incentives, cross-departmental data sharing) should be implemented. Based on budget reallocation which is financially viable, technical viability with the smart city infrastructure in Hong Kong which will increase the recycling contribution of the G@C program to 3-5%, unit costs will be reduced by 25%, and participation of the people will increase by 20%, which will form a solid base to achieve the Hong Kong 2035 55% recycling target.

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

The Green@Community program has reached a point of diminishing returns. Despite exponential spending (projected >HK$475 million), Hong Kong's recycling rate remains stagnant. Our analysis confirms that the strategy of "blind expansion" is no longer cost-effective. The core failures are strategic (incentives are too weak to overcome the opportunity cost for non-users) and governance-related (opaque data prevents optimization).

### Limitations & Future Work

Our study was limited by a small, youth-skewed sample (n=128) and significant gaps in government data due to "passive disclosure." Future research should prioritize:

- **Demographic Sampling:** Surveying the elderly (the current core user base) to ensure inclusivity.
- **A/B Testing:** Piloting different incentive structures (e.g., e-coupons vs. staples) to find the most cost-efficient motivator.
- **Longitudinal Tracking:** Monitoring the "cost-per-tonne" efficiency over a 3-year period.

### Reflection on Data Governance

This research highlights that accessibility equates to accountability. Although the government collects data, burying it in PDF reports rather than hosting it on open platforms like data.gov.hk renders it useless for public oversight. To achieve the "Smart City" vision, the government must pivot from "passive disclosure" to radical transparency. We learned that without accessible data, policy becomes a black box; with it, it becomes a community-driven tool for improvement.

Dear Access to Information Officer of the Environmental Protection Department,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am an undergraduate at Hong Kong Baptist University taking a course GCAP3226: Empowering Citizens through Data. Our group project, "Green@Community Recycling Network Analysis," evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Green@Community and aims to inform resource allocation.

To support our analysis, we request statistical summaries or datasets for the same most recent 3 full calendar years (e.g., "1 Jan 2022 to 31 Dec 2024"). If data for 3 years is unavailable, just the latest 1 or 2 years would be appreciated. If that period is unavailable, the closest available period or partial datasets/statistical summaries (e.g., different ranges, quarterly/monthly series, or earlier years) would be appreciated.

#### Purpose and Use

Data will be used only for this course project; findings shared in class, a final report, and a briefing to a current Legislative Council member. We will acknowledge EPD and follow any conditions.

#### Data we would like to request:

**1. GREEN$ mobile app (GREEN$ ePIS)**

*User Base:*
- Total number of registered GREEN$ ePIS users
- Monthly and annual active users in the period (e.g., active users are those who earned GREEN$ through recycling at least once within the period)

*User Demographics (aggregate/anonymized; counts OR percentages OR dataset without PII):*
- Registered user demographics by segments AND; monthly AND annual active user demographics by segments
  - by age OR age group
  - by gender
  - by residential district
  - by residential building type
  - by occupation

*Participation Intensity (aggregate/anonymized; counts OR percentages OR dataset without PII):*
- Annual AND monthly total GREEN$ gained by all users
- Annual AND monthly GREEN$ gained per active user by segments
  - by age OR age group
  - by gender
  - by residential district
  - by residential building type
  - by occupation

*Activity Metrics (aggregate/anonymized; counts OR percentages OR dataset without PII):*
- Annual AND monthly total GREEN$-earning transaction count
- Annual AND monthly GREEN$-earning transaction count per active user by segment

**2. Green@Community Recycling Facility Visitor Volume and Recycling Volume**

*Visitor Volume:*
- Annual AND monthly visitor counts for Green@Community facilities (recycling station, stores, and spots)
- Annual AND monthly visitor counts by facility type (recycling station/stores/spots)
- Annual AND monthly visitor counts by each facility

*Contribution to Hong Kong's Overall Recycling:*
- Annual total municipal solid waste generated in HK
- Annual total recyclables collected in HK
- Annual proportion of recyclables handled by Green@Community facilities relative to HK's total recyclables overall

*Recycling Volume:*
- Annual total recycled weight by Green@Community
- Annual recycled weight by facility type (recycling station/stores/spots)
- Annual recycled weight by each facility

*Geographic Utilization:*
- Annual AND monthly recycled weight
  - by district
  - by facility type (recycling station/stores/spots)
  - by each facility

**3. Green@Community Operations and Operating Costs**

*Operating Costs:*
- Annual total operating cost
- Any available breakdowns of the operating costs (e.g., staffing, rent, utilities, logistics, maintenance, processing fees, etc.) (if detailed price breakdowns are not available, aggregate breakdowns with just naming what kind of costs are included in it will be appreciated)

*Scale / Inputs:*
- Number of facilities by residential district
- Number of facilities by facility type
- Floor area of recycling stores in total OR of each store
- Staffing counts in total AND by function AND by employment type
- Unit-cost indicators (e.g., operating cost per recycled weight in terms of tonne)

#### Format and Documentation:

- Preferred: CSV/Excel/Open API (PDFs acceptable)
- Including brief definitions/notes would be good (e.g., material categories, fiscal vs. calendar year)
- Partial aggregates or public references are welcome if full data are not available

Please let us know if there are application forms, non-disclosure requirements, or a designated data request channel we should follow.

Thank you for your time and assistance.
